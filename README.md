This project is built with reference of the course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects!" @Udemy.com

It is a simple dice game with just a single die. 

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she whishes. Each result get added to his/her ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his/her ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his/her ROUND score gets added to his/her TOTAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 or more points on TOTAL score wins the game
