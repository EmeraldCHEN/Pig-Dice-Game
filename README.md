# Pig Dice Game - a simple JS game


This program is mostly the project from the vedio course named The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects! @Udemy

It is a simple dice game with just a single die. 

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.
